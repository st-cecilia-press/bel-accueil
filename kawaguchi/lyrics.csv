河口の,kawaguchi no,the river's mouth,At Kawaguchi
関の荒垣や,seki no aragaki ya,a gate in the rough wall,There is a gateway in the wall.
関の荒垣や,seki no aragaki ya,a gate in the rough wall,"There is a gateway in the wall,"
まもれどもはれ,mamoredomo hare,"a guard guarding, hare",And there's a guard to guard it.
,,,
まもれども,mamoredomo,a guard guarding,A guard to guard it:
出でて我寝ぬや,idete ware nenu ya,"going out, I sleep",But I got through and went to sleep.
出でて我寝ぬや,idete ware nenu ya,"going out, I sleep","But I got through and went to sleep,"
関の荒垣,seki no aragaki,a gate in the rough wall,Got through the strong wall's gateway.
