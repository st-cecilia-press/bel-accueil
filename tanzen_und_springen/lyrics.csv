Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Tanzen und springen,","Dancing and jumping,","Dancing and springing,"
"Singen und klingen,",Singing and sounding:,Singing and ringing:
Lauten und Geigen,Lutes and violins,"Each lute and fiddle,"
"SollÅfn auch nicht schweigen,",Should not be silent.,Shout from the middle!
Zu musizieren,To play music,Playing my measure
Und jubilieren,And be joyful,In simple pleasure
steht mir all mein Sinn.,Is everything to me.,Is all that I ask.
,,
Sch?ne Jungfrauen,Beautiful young women,Lovely young lasses
"In gr?ner Auen,",In green pastures:,Mid meadow grasses:
Mit ihnÅfn spazieren,Walking with them,"Next to them walking,"
"Und converzieren,","And talking with them,","Long with them talking,"
"Freundlich zu scherzen,","Joking in a friendly way,","Their joking patter,"
Freut mich im Herzen,Gladdens my heart,All make me gladder
f?r Silber und Gold.,More than silver and gold.,Than silver and gold.
,,
Hans Leo Hassler,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
