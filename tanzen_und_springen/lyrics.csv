Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Tanzen und springen,","Dancing and jumping,","Dancing and springing,"
"Singen und klingen,",Singing and sounding:,Singing and ringing:
Lauten und Geigen,Lutes and violins,"Each lute and fiddle,"
"Soll’n auch nicht schweigen,",Should not be silent.,Shout from the middle!
Zu musizieren,To play music,Playing my measure
Und jubilieren,And be joyful,In simple pleasure
steht mir all mein Sinn.,Is everything to me.,Is all that I ask.
,,
Schöne Jungfrauen,Beautiful young women,Lovely young lasses
"In gröner Auen,",In green pastures:,Mid meadow grasses:
Mit ihn’n spazieren,Walking with them,"Next to them walking,"
"Und converzieren,","And talking with them,","Long with them talking,"
"Freundlich zu scherzen,","Joking in a friendly way,","Their joking patter,"
Freut mich im Herzen,Gladdens my heart,All make me gladder
för Silber und Gold.,More than silver and gold.,Than silver and gold.
,,
