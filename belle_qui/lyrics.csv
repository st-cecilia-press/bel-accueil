Belle qui tiens ma vie,Beauty who holds my life,"Beauty, my whole existence"
"captive dans tes yeux,","Captive in your eyes,",Is captive to your eyes;
Qui m'as l'âme ravie,Who delighted me,"Joys, at my soul's insistence,"
"d'un souriz gracieux,","With a gracious smile,",Upon your smile arise.
"Viens tôt me secourir,","Come quickly to help me,","Come and my pains allay,"
ou me faudra mourir.,Or I must die.,Or I shall pass away.
,,
"Pourquoi fuis-tu, mignarde,","Why do you run away, cutie,","Why, sweetheart, would you flee me"
si je suis près de toi?,If I am near you?,Each time our paths have crossed?
Quand tes yeux je regarde,"When I look into your eyes,","Sharing your gaze so freely,"
"je me perds dedans moi,","I get lost in myself,",Inside myself I'm lost:
Car tes perfections,For your perfections,Each perfect thing you do
changent mes actions.,Change my actions.,"Betters my actions, too."
,,
Tes beautés et ta grace,Your beauties and your grace,"Your beauty and your graces,"
"et tes divins propos,",And your divinity,"Your goal, which Heaven owns,"
Ont échauffé la glace,Melted the ice,Melted with warm embraces
"qui me gelait les os,","Which froze my bones,",The ice that froze my bones
Et ont rempli mon cŁEur,And filled my heart,And filled my frozen heart
d'une amoureuse ardeur.,With loving ardor.,With love in every part.
,,
Mon âme vouleit être,My soul wanted to be,"My soul, in fear, had wanted"
"libre de passion,","Free of passion,","Of passion to be free,"
Mais l'amour s'est fait maître,But Love has become master,"But Love came in, undaunted,"
"de mes affections,","Of my affections,",And mastered all of me.
Et a mis sou sa loi,And has put his law,He set his law above
et mon cŁEur et ma foi.,Over my heart and my faith.,"My heart, my faith, my love."
,,
"Approche donc ma belle,","Come close, then, my beauty,","Then, lovely one, come near me;"
"approche toi mon bien,","Come close, my good,","Come close, my little one."
Ne me sois plus revelle,"Do not rebel against me anymore,",Do not rebel or fear me:
"puisque mon cŁEur est tien,",Since my heart is yours.,My heart you've fully won.
"Pour mon mal appaiser,","To ease my pain,","This aching to dismiss,"
donne moi un baiser.,Give me a kiss.,Give me your perfect kiss.
,,
"Je meurs, mon Angelette,","I am dying, my little angel,","Sweet angel, I am dying"
"je meurs en te baisant,","I am dying in your kiss,","Each time your lips touch mine,"
Ta bouche tant doucette,Your mouth so sweet,Your mouth to mine applying
"va mon bien ravissant,",Gives me delight.,Delight beyond divine.
A ce coup mes esprits,"At this stroke, my mind","One touch and bliss I knew,"
sont tous d'amour épris.,Became all in love with love.,In love with loving you.
,,
Plutôt on verra l'onde,Sooner will the waves,"Drying, the Seas of Seven"
"contrement reculer,","Recoil from the mountain,","Will from the mountains turn,"
Et plutôt lŁEil du monde,And sooner the Eye of the World,"Paling, the Eye of Heaven"
"Cessera de brûler,","Will cease to burn,",Will fade and cease to burn
Que l'amour qui m'époint,Than the love which binds me,Before the love I feel
décroisse d'un seul point.,Will decrease by a single point.,Weakens or grows less real.
