"CaritasÂ habundat in omnia,","Love abounds in everything,","Charity abounds here toward all of us,"
"de imis excellentissima super sidera,","From the lowest depths to the highest stars,","From deepest depths is exalted high past the moon and stars,"
"atque amantissima in omnia,","And is loving to all,",And is truly loving and a friend to all;
quia summo Regi osculum pacis dedit.,For the supreme King gave a kiss of peace.,See how from the King it peacefully falls like kisses.
