Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Psallat scholarum concio,The scholars sing in assembly,Sing we scholars collectively
"in hoc convivio,","at this banquet,","In this festivity,"
Sed Mariæ Filio,but the Son of God,Yet recall effectively
non sit oblivio,is not to be forgotten:,The Lord's Nativity:
"Nam is dat solatia,","In fact, it gives solace,",For His tender graciousness
"sua bona gratia,","his good grace,",Grants a soothing spaciousness
studentibus in trivio.,to students in the gutter.,To clerks in doubt's captivity.
,,
Extinxit ignem sceleris,"He extinguished the fire of sin,",Who ends sin with His sure commands
"hic dator gratiæ,",this giver of grace;,His Grace awaited brings;
"Extans fructus fœderis,",the fruit of the covenant exists,Promised One securely stands
"in orbis acie,",in a world of battle.,"Where battle, hated, springs."
"Per quem regnant reguli,","Through this reigns the prince,","In this Prince's dominance,"
"super orbem seculi,","over the whole world,",All will bless his prominence
Cuncti in terræ facie.,all the face of the Earth.,Before all Earth's created things.
,,
Totius orci saeviit,All death raged,"Strong was Death's vile severity,"
"sævi potentia,","with fierce power,","Its cruel malevolence,"
Dum puella genuit,when the girl gave birth,But a girl with charity
"Dei clementia,",to the mercy of God:,Showed God's benevolence:
"Mundus quidem aruit,","The world was certainly withered,","Withered once, notorious,"
"sed iam virens claruit,","but now it shone with green,","Now Earth's green and glorious,"
Et eius simul entia.,and all beings with it.,All beings share a breath and sense.
,,
Respexit nos diluculo,We looked early,We who gazed at the sky above
"qui ardet fulmine,","who were burned by lightning,","The lightning caught afire,"
Caritatis oculo,the eye of love,"Wounded by the Eye of Love,"
"à cœli culmine,",from the summit of Heaven.,In Heaven met desire.
"Venit huc ut folveret,","He came here to set us free,","He came, having been unbound;"
"quos æstus involveret,",who were surrounded by fire,Warmth the world did then surround:
Christus suo fulcimine.,and who support Christ.,Our Christ support can yet inspire.
,,
Conemur ergo lilij,We seek therefore among the lilies,From these lilies endeavoring
"hunc florem legere,",to gather this flower.,"To pick the majority,"
Ut nos partus filij,To us is born a child,The Son's birth to ever sing
"possit protegere,",who can protect.,Is our priority:
Hunc omnis felicitas,In this happiness everyone,So we pray for cheerfulness
"oret et clericitas,",and the clerics pray,And a scholar's fearfulness
Ut det nos secum regere.,that we be given more leadership.,To honor His authority.
,,
Certatim laudes concinent,Earnestly singing praises all together,"Praising Him voluntarily,"
"cœli palatio,","to the palace of Heaven,",Extol divinity;
"Christo Iesu iubilent,","rejoice in Christ Jesus,","Sing to Jesus merrily,"
"quos regit ratio,",who rules the reckoning.,Who rules Infinity.
Hunc omnis deifice,All deify him,We adore and deify
collaudet mirifice,and highly extol the wonder,Whom did God's love reify:
Triplatæ vitæ statio.,of the life-giving Trinity.,The wonder of the Trinity.
