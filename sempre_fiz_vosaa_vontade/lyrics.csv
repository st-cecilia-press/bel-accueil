Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Sempre fiz vossa vontade,"I always did your will,",I always did what you wanted;
mas agora,but now,But no longer
não sois vos minha señora,you are not my lady.,Are you she whom I must honor.
,,
No tempo que mais folgaua,"When it was most pleasant,",Those times when we seemed so happy --
mór engano recebia,I was badly deceived.,Why did I not see right through you?
se com razão me queixaua,That I was right to complain,But now I have grown more savvy;
co contrairo me vencia.,I am convinced.,I was right to hate what you do.
,,
O quam mal vos conhecia,O you whom I hardly knew --,I know that I barely knew you;
mas agora,but now,But no longer
não sois vos minha señora.,you are not my lady.,Are you she whom I must honor.
,,
