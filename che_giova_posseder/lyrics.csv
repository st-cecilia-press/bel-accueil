Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Che giova posseder cittadi e regni,How good it is to possess cities and kingdoms,"What joy to have great kingdoms, cities, towers,"
e palagi abitar d'alto lavoro,and palaces to dwell in of high workmanship,"And mansions built with art deep and unmeasured,"
e servi intorno aver d'imperio regni,"and servants around you, to reign over an empire,","With servants all around, an empire’s power,"
di porpora vestir mangiar in oro,"to dress in purple, to eat from gold,","Wear purple, eat from gold, have every pleasure,"
esser cantato da sublimi ingegni,to have one’s sublime intellect sung about,"To hear one’s genius sung and praises showered,"
e le arche gravi aver pien di tesoro,"and have deep chests full of treasure,","And have enormous chests laden with treasure,"
con l'alta fama arrivar fino al polo,"with great fame to arrive finally at the ultimate extremity,","Finally reach it, sheer magnificence only –"
morendo poi nel letto freddo e solo.,"and then to die in a cold bed, alone.","And die upon a mattress, cold and lonely."
