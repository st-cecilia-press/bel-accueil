Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Robins m'aime, Robins m'a,","Robin loves me, Robin has me,",Robin loves me; we're a pair.
"Robins m'a demandée,","Robin has asked me,",Robin asked me so sweetly
Si m'ara.,if he will have me.,If I care.
Robins m'cata cotele,Robin bought me a robe,Robin gave me so discreetly
"D'escarlate bone et bele,","Of beautiful, superior quality cloth,","Clothes made of fine cloth completely,"
"Souskanie et chainturele,",A smooth and a narrow girtle.,Smocks and belts that fasten neatly:
A leur I va.,"For them I consent. [lit., I go for that!]",For that I'm there!
"Robins m'aime, Robins m'a,","Robin loves me, Robin has me,",Robin loves me; we're a pair.
"Robins m'a demandée,","Robin has asked me,",Robin asked me so sweetly
Si m'ara.,if he will have me.,If I care.
