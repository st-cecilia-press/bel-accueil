Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Sol, sol, gi, gi, A.B.C.","Sol sol, G, G, A, B, C.","Sol sol gee gee A B C,"
Enamoradico vengo,Lovingly I come,With love in my heart I'm coming
"De la, sol, fa, mi, re, ut.","With la, sol, fa, mi, re, ut.",With la sol fa mi re ut.
,,
Iba a ver a mi madre,"I was going to see my mother,","Visiting my mother dear,"
A quien mucho amé.,Whom I loved very much.,I am on my way.
,,
Íbame cantando,"I went singing,","Singing all along the road,"
lo que os diré:,And what I sang I will tell you:,Here's what I say:
,,
"Sol, sol, gi, gi, A.B.C.","Sol sol, G, G, A, B, C.","Sol sol gee gee A B C,"
Enamoradico vengo,Lovingly I come,With love in my heart I'm coming
"De la, sol, fa, mi, re, ut.","With la, sol, fa, mi, re, ut.",With la sol fa mi re ut.
