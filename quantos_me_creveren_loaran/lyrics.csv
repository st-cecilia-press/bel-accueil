Esta é de loor de Santa María.,This is in praise of Holy Mary.,
,,
Quantos me crevéren loarán ,All who believe me will praise,All those who believe my words will praise
a Virgen que nos mantên.,The Virgin who sustains us.,Her who us in life sustains.
,,
Ca sen ela Déus non averán,For without Her they will not have God,"Without Her they will not know God’s ways,"
Quantos me crevéren loarán,All who believe me will praise,-- All those who believe my words will praise --
nenas sas fazendas ben farán,Nor will they live their lives well,"Nor will peace and goodness fill their days,"
Quantos me crevéren loarán ,All who believe me will praise,-- All those who believe my words will praise --
neno ben de Déus connocerán;,Nor know God’s blessings:,Nor upon God’s blessings will they gaze.
e tal consello lles dou porên.,"Therefore, I give them this counsel.",My advice for them this song explains:
,,
Quantos me crevéren loarán ,All who believe me will praise,All those who believe my words will praise
a Virgen que nos mantên.,The Virgin who sustains us.,Her who us in life sustains.
,,
E con tod' esto serví-la-an,"Furthermore, they will serve Her","And they’ll serve and all Her words obey,"
Quantos me crevéren loarán,All who believe me will praise,-- All those who believe my words will praise --
e de séu prazer non saïrán,And never lose Her good favor,And Her grace on them will always stay;
Quantos me crevéren loarán,All who believe me will praise,-- All those who believe my words will praise --
"e mais d' outra ren a amarán,",And love Her above all else;,They will Her above all others raise:
e serán per i de mui bon sen;,In this way they act wisely.,This way wisdom’s help with them remains.
,,
Quantos me crevéren loarán ,All who believe me will praise,All those who believe my words will praise
a Virgen que nos mantên. ,The Virgin who sustains us.,Her who us in life sustains.
