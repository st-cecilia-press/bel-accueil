E d' al ll' avẽo aínda mui peior:,And something much worse happened to him:,"And not only did he injury sustain,",
"esmoreceu con coita e con door,","he fainted in shock and pain,","But he fainted dead away from shock and pain,",
e Nóstro Sennor,and Our Lord,"And he went insane,",
sen tod' aquest' a fala lle tollía,in addition took away his speech,"And he couldn't speak a whisper, or barely.",
,,,
"En tal guisa, que pois nunca disse ren",so that he could never say anything,Mary's name was all he could say anymore.,
"érgo ""ai, Santa María."" E des ên","except ""Oh, Holy Mary,"" and after that,","After that, insane and maimed, he wandered, poor,",
tolleit' e sen sen,"maimed and crazy,","Begging door to door,",
