"Et de tes biens souffre le paistre,",,And suffer us without disaster
"Sans desordonné appetit,",,"To graze with peaceful appetite,"
Nourrissant petit à petit,,"And nourish slowly, bite by bite,"
"A ce jour d'huy ta creature,",,"This little body, Your creation,"
Par celluy qui pour nous vestit,,I pray through Him who left Your light
Ung corps subject à nourriture.,,And hunger felt for our salvation.
