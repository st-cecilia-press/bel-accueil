大路に,ōji ni,on the highway,Along the highway
沿ひて上れる,soite noboreru,running along above it,"To run beside, climbing up,"
青柳が花や,aoyagi ga hana ya,green willows bud,Tender willow trees are in bloom;
青柳が花や,aoyagi ga hana ya,green willows bud,Tender willow trees are in bloom.

青柳が,aoyagi ga,green willows,Tender willow trees:
撓ひを見れば,shinai o mireba,see them drooping,"If you look and see the spruce,"
今盛りなりや,ima sakari nari ya,now is the height of the season,All the world is in blossom now;
今盛りなりや,ima sakari nari ya,now is the height of the season,All the world is in blossom now.
