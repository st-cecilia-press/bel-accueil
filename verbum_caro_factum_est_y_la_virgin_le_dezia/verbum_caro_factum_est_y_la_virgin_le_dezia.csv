Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Verbum caro factum est,The Word is made flesh,Now the Word has been made flesh
Porque todos os salvéis.,So that all may be saved.,So that you may all be saved.
,,
Y la Virgen le dezía:,And the Virgin said to him:,Hear the Virgin Mother sighing:
"Vida de la vida mia,","Life of my life,","""Life of my own life here lying,"
"Hijo mio, ¿qué os haría,","My son, What should I do","Son, how can I calm your crying"
Que no tengo en qué os echéis?,For I have no clothes with which to clothe you?,"With no clothes, whose warmth you crave?"""
,,
"O riquezas terrenales,","O rich of this world,","You with all your earthly riches,"
¿No daréis unos pañales,Will you not give some swaddling clothes,Won't you give a few small stitches
A Jesu que entre animales,"To Jesus, who among the animals","To the babe in barns and ditches,"
Es nasçido según véis?,"Is born, as you see?","Born with beasts, who sins forgave?"
,,
