Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Veris dulcis in tempore,Truly sweet in the time,"Spring is sweet, and green is growing"
florenti stat sub arbore,of flowering stands under a tree,"Neath the tree; her sister showing,"
Iuliana cum sorore.,Juliana with her sister.,Juliana's glad and glowing:
,,
Dulcis amor!,Sweet love!,How sweet this need!
"Qui te caret hoc tempore,",Those who are without you at this time,Those who are of Spring unknowing
fit vilior.,are truly poor.,Are poor indeed.
,,
"Ecce florescunt arbores,","Look, the trees are blooming;",See the trees with blossoms clinging;
lascive canunt volucres;,the birds sing wantonly;,"Lustily the birds are singing,"
inde tepescunt virgines.,thereby the virgins cool themselves.,Breezes to the virgins bringing:
,,
"Ecce florescunt lilia,","Look, the lilies are blooming,",See the lily where it blazes;
et virginum dant agmina,and the virgins give to the ranks,Every virgin gladly raises
summo deorum carmina.,of the highest gods songs.,To the gods the highest praises:
,,
"Si tenerem, quam cupio,","If you hold me, as I desire,","If my one desire were granted,"
"in nemore sub folio,","in the forest under the leaves,",In the forest shadows slanted
oscularer cum gaudio.,I will kiss you with joy.,"I would kiss my love, enchanted:"
,,
