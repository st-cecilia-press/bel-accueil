梅が枝に,mumegae ni,to the plum branches,To the plum tree's arms
来ゐる鶯や,kiiru uguisu ya,comes the nightingale,Comes the nightingale with her song
春かけて　はれ,haru kakete hare,"spring arrives, oh","Throughout the springtime, la, hey,"
,,,
春かけて,haru kakete,spring arrives,"Through the whole springtime,"
鳴けどもいまだや,nakedomo imada ya,singing now,And she sings her song even now.
雪は降りつつ,yuki wa furitsutsu,the snow falls,The snow keeps on falling down.
,,,
あわれ　そこよしや,aware soko yoshi ya,a pity that even there,"Oh, alas! for here where I am,"
雪は降りつつ,yuki wa furitsutsu,the snow falls,The snow keeps on falling down.
