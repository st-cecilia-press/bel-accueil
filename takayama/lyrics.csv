鷹山に,takayama ni,on Hawk Mountain,"Upon Hawk Mountain,"
鷹を　鷹を放ちあげ,taka o taka o hanachi age,"set free the hawk, the hawk","The hawk, oh, the hawk set free, set it free,"
招ぐをなみ　あわれ,ogu o nami aware,"wave an invitation, pity","And at this summons, I am moved;"
招ぐをなみ　はれ,ogu o nami hare,"wave an invitation, clear skies","And at this summons, I weep."

招ぐをなみ,ogu o nami,wave an invitation,And at this summons
我がす　我がする時に,waga su waga suru toki ni,at the time for me to act,"When I leave, when I leave and fly away,"
逢える夫かもや,aeru sena kamo ya,might I meet my husband,"My husband, will we meet again?"
逢える夫かもや,aeru sena kamo ya,might I meet my husband,"My husband, will we meet again?"
