御裳食むつ,omushō tsumutsu,eat the skirts,All together they feast upon
袈裟食むつ,kesa tsumutsu,the skirts of the Buddhist robes,"The robes of the monks,"
袈裟食むつ,kesa tsumutsu,the skirts of the Buddhist robes,The robes of the monks.

法師に申さむ,hōshi ni mōsamu,call the priests,Call the priests; call for the clerics;
師に申せ,shi ni mōse,call the teachers,To the teachers call.
