"In dulci jubilo,",LINK,Let shouts of joy ascend!
Nun singet und seid froh!,http://www0.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/In_dulci_jubilo,Your voices gladly blend!
Unsers Herzens Wonne liegt,See translation at Choral Public Domain Library.,For our heart's desire
"in praesepio,",,"Did to a trough descend,"
Und leuchtet als die Sonne,,"Like sunlight's shining fire,"
"Matris in gremio,",,"In mother's lap our Friend,"
Alpha es et O!,,He the start and end!
,,
O Jesu parvule,,"O Jesus, small and new,"
Nach dir ist mir so weh!,,"I suffer, lacking you!"
Tröst' mir mein Gemüte,,"Come and easy my aching,"
O puer optime,,"O Baby, best who grew,"
Durch alle deine Güte,,"In kindness comfortmaking,"
O princeps gloriae.,,O Prince of glory true.
Trahe me post te!,,Draw me there to you!
,,
O Patris caritas!,,O Father's loving care!
O Nati lenitas!,,O gentle Baby rare!
Wir wären all verloren,,"Surely sin had chained us,"
Per nostra crimina,,In all the ways we err.
So hat er uns erworben,,But out of love you gained us
Coelorum gaudia,,The joys of Heaven fair.
"Eia, wären wir da!",,"Oh, we wish we were there!"
,,
Ubi sunt gaudia?,,"Where is gladness, where?"
Nirgend mehr denn da!,,No place more than there!
Da die Engel singen,,Angels there are singing
"Nova cantica,",,"New-made songs in prayer,"
Und die Schellen klingen,,And the bells are ringing
In regis curia.,,With King and court to share.
"Eia, wären wir da!",,"Oh, we wish we were there!"
,,
Heinrich Suso,,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
