"O virtus Sapientiae,",LINK,"O strength of Wisdom Beyond Time,"
quae circuiens circuisti,http://www2.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/O_Virtus_Sapientiae_(Hildegard_von_Bingen),"who, in making circles, circled all,"
comprehendendo omnia,See translation at Choral Public Domain Library.,thus encompassing everything
"in una via, quae habet vitam,",,"in just one pathway, all life conferring,"
"tres alas habens,",,with three wings You fly:
"quarum una in altum volat,",,"One wing soars to the highest heavens,"
"et altera de terra sudat,",,and one distills on earth its essence;
et tertia undique volat.,,the third wing suffuses existence.
"Laus tibi sit, sicut te decet,",,"All praise to You, just as is fitting,"
O Sapientia.,,O Wisdom Beyond Time.
