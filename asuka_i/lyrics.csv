飛鳥井に,asuka-i ni,at Asuka [Flying Bird] well,Here beside the well
宿りはすべし　おけ,yadori wa subeshi oke,[we] should dwell,Let us live: The well of Asuka.
陰もよし,kage mo yoshi,there is excellent shade and,"Shade is abundant,"
御水も寒し,mimoi mo samushi,the water is cold and,And the water here is cool.
御秣もよし,mimakusa mo yoshi,there is excellent hay,The grasses also flourish.
