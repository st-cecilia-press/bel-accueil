”ò’¹ˆä‚É,asuka-i ni,at Asuka [Flying Bird] well,Here beside the well
h‚è‚Í‚·‚×‚µ@‚¨‚¯,yadori wa subeshi oke,[we] should dwell,Let us live: The well of Asuka.
‰A‚à‚æ‚µ,kage mo yoshi,there is excellent shade and,"Shade is abundant,"
Œä…‚àŠ¦‚µ,mimoi mo samushi,the water is cold and,And the water here is cool.
Œäâa‚à‚æ‚µ,mimakusa mo yoshi,there is excellent hay,The grasses also flourish.
