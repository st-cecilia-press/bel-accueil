Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation,Note
Carole magnus eras,"Charles, you were great","Charles our King, you were mighty","Plus ultra (""further beyond"") was the personal motto of Charles V."
cum solus regna tenebas,when you held only a kingdom;,When one Kingdom was all your realm;,
major ab imperio,you were greater with an empire;,More so as an Emperor;,
maximus a puero,you are greatest in your son.,Mightiest through this your son.,
Rex multos Caesar,As King you ruled many; as Emperor,"Kingdom, then empire:",
plures ditione tenebas.,even more lands you held.,Still more immense domains you wielded.,
,,,
Nunc omnes nato tu regis a puero,Now through your son you rule all.,Now all the nations you govern through this your son.,
Roma tua est,"Rome is yours,","Rome itself is yours,",
Europa tua est,"Europe is yours,","And Europe also yours,",
"Asia, Africa tota","Asia, all of Africa.","Asia yours, all Africa, too.",
quid plus ultra,"What ""further beyond"" is there?",What lies farther?,
non potes,You cannot have more,There's nothing;,
omnia habes.,because you have everything.,You rule the whole world.,
,,,
