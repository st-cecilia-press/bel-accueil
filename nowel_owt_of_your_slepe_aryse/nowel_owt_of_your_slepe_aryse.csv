"For God mankynd nowe hath ytake,","For God has now taken on human flesh,",For God the form of man will take
Al of a maide without eny make;,Of a maiden without any mate;,All of a maid who no sin could make;
Of al women she bereth the belle.,"Of all women, she bears the bell. [i.e., she is the leader]",Of all women she bears the bell.

Now man is made of ful grete pris;,Now man is made of great worth;,Now man is given such a prize;
"Now angelys knelen to mannys servys,","Now angels kneel in service to man,","Now angels will kneel and be man's allies,"
And at this tyme al this byfel.,And at this time all this befell.,And at this time all this befell.

And his moder emperesse of helle.,"And His mother, Empress over Hell.","And His Mother, Empress of Hell."

Now shal God deme both the and me,Now shall God consider both you and me,Now shall God bring both you and me
Unto his blysse yf we do wel.,Worthy of His bliss if we do what is good.,Into His bliss if we do well.
Nowel!,Noel!,Noel!

Now man may to heven wende;,Now man may go to Heaven;,Now mankind may to Heaven wend;
Now heven and erthe to hym they bende;,Now Heaven and earth bend to him;,Now Heaven and Earth to him they bend;

This is no nay that Y yowe telle.,What I tell you is undeniable.,This is no lie that I you tell.
Nowel!,Noel!,Noel!

"That we mow there synge, ""Nowel"".","That we may sing there, ""Noel"".","That we may there sing out, ""Noel."""
