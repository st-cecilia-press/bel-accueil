Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Contre raison vous me faites fort estrenge.,"Against reason, you seem very strange to me.","Lacking reason, you are baffling and unnerving."
Esse bien faict? En aurez vous louenge?,Have I done well? Will you praise me?,Have I done well? Please praise if I’m deserving!
D'ainsi m'avoir soudain desherité,To have thus suddenly disinherited me,"Thus suddenly from love me to dismiss,"
"de vostr'amour, sans l'avoir merité.","from your love, without having deserved it --",Although I merit no treatment like this --
Vous faict il mal sans vous servir me renge?,Does it hurt you if I am set on serving you?,What do you lose if I am set on serving?
