Qu'adès sans tricherie,,For honestly and bravely

Tous les jours de ma vie,,"And thinking of you chastely,"
Servie,,"Not basely,"
Sans villain pensement.,,I've lived my life alone.

Helas! et je mendie,,"Alas, I beg you lamely"

Se pité ne vous en prent.,,All my joy from me has flown.

Mais vo douce maistrie,,"Your power, fair and stately,"

Mon cuer si durement,,Your rule is harsh as stone.

Qu'elle le contralie,,"Your sweet dominion pains me,"

Et se ne li ottrie,,Yet I desire you vainly
Vos cuers nul aligement.,,For your heart denies my own.

Car trop langui longuement.,,For too long this pain I've known.
