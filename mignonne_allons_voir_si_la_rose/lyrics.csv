"Mignonne, allon voir si la rose",LINK,"Sweetheart, let's see the rose together,"
Qui ce matin avoit declose,http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=13861,"Which, in this morning's sun-warmed weather,"
"Sa robe de pourpr' au soleil,",See Faith J. Cormier's work at LiederNet Archive.,"Opened her purple robes and shone,"
"A point perdu, cette vesprée,",,And let us see if she this evening
"Le plis de sa robe pourprée,",,For having lost her robes is grieving;
Et son teint au vostre pareil.,,Her color is so like your own.
,,
"Las, voyés comm' en peu d'espace,",,"See how she lost in so few hours,"
"Mignonn', ell' a dessus la place,",,"Sweetheart, her place among the flowers,"
"Las, las, ses beautés laissé cheoir!",,Her beauties fallen by the way.
"ÁE vrayement maratre nature,",,And Nature is a cruel stepmother
"Puis qu'une telle fleur ne dure,",,"That such a beauty, like no other,"
Que du matin jusques au soir!,,Only could last a single day.
,,
"Donc, si vous me croiés, mignonne:",,"Sweetheart, if you believe this warning,"
Tandis que vostr' age fleuronne,,"Now, while your life is in its morning,"
"En sa plus verte nouveauté,",,"While still in blossom, green and free,"
"Cueillés, cueillés vostre jeunesse,",,"Harvest, oh, harvest youth: It frees you;"
"Comm' à cette fleur, la viellesse",,"Just like the rose, old age will leave you"
Fera ternir vostre beauté.,,Only a withered memory.
,,
Pierre de Ronsard,,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
