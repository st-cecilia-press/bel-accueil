Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Quivi sospiri pianti et alti guai,","There sighs, tears, and loud cries of woe","Sighing and weeping, screeches of fear and madness,"
"Rissonavan per l'aer senza stelle,","Resounded through a sky without stars,","Filled a sky without stars with deep vibrations,"
"Perch' io al cominciar ne lagrimai,",So that I at first wept at them:,"And hearing, I wept with overwhelming sadness"
"Diverse lingue horribili favelle,","Foreign tongues, horrible dialects,","At tortured phrases, abhorrent intonations,"
"Parole di dolore accenti d'ira,","Words of pain, accents of anger,","At words of pain and anguish, at tones of fury,"
Voci alte et fioche et suon di man con elle.,"Voices shrill and dim, and the sounds of wringing hands with them.","Shrill voices and distant, and twisting hands' frustrations."
