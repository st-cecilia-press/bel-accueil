Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
O magnum mysterium,O great mystery,"How boundless a mystery,"
"et admirabile sacramentum,",and remarkable sacrament:,"this most remarkable, holy promise:"
ut animalia viderent Dominum natum,That animals see the newborn Lord,That animals would see the Lord a newly born baby
iacentem in praesepio.,lying in a manger.,and lying in a bed of hay.
"O beata Virgo,","O blessed Virgin,","O most blessed Virgin,"
cujus viscera meruerunt,whose flesh was worthy,whose commendable flesh was worthy
portare Dominum Iesum Christum.,"to carry the Lord, Jesus Christ.","to bear the Lord within, Lord Christ Jesus."
Alleluia!,Alleluia!,Alleluia!
