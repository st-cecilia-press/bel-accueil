Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Sub umbrâ illius,","Beneath his shadow,",In heat cooled and shaded
quem desiderabam sedi,"whom I longed for, I sat down,",by the one I longed for sat I;
et fructus ejus dulcis gutturi meo.,and his fruit tasted sweet to me.,his fruit was pleasant and ripe: How sweet its flavor!
Introduxit me rex in cellam vinariam,The King brought me into his wine cellar,For the King has brought me here into his wine cellar;
ordinavit in me charitatem.,and ordained love for me.,by his will he set his love upon me.
"Fulcite me floribus,",Sustain me with flowers;,"Sustain me with blooming flowers,"
stipate me malis,"surround me with apples,","surround me with apples,"
quia amore langueo.,for I am sick with love.,for love afflicts me with longing.
