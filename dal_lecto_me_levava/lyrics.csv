Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Dal lecto me levava,From my bed I rose,At break of dawn I rose up
Per servir il Signor.,in order to serve the Lord.,"From bed to serve the Lord,"
Alhor quando arrivava,Then arrived,But then his servant showed up:
"La grua suo servidor,","the crane, his vassal,","The crane, his gentle ward,"
"Gru, gru, gru, gru,","Gru, gru, gru, gru,","Groo, groo, groo, groo,"
Gentil ambasciador,"Kind ambassador,","Kindest ambassador,"
"Che disse non leve,",who said: Don't get up;,"Who told me, Don't get up;"
Torne adormir.,go back to sleep.,Go back to sleep.
"Ognun dica,","Everyone says,","Everybody,"
"Gru, gru, gru, gru,","Gru, gru, gru, gru,","Groo, groo, groo, groo,"
Torne adormir.,go back to sleep.,Go back to sleep.
