ˆÉ¨‚ÌŠC‚Ì,ise no umi no,the sea at Ise,"The ocean at Ise,"
‚«‚æ‚«‚É,kiyoki nagisa ni,the pure beach,"With its beaches clean, flawless,"
’ªŠÔ‚É,shiogai ni,at low tide,When tide is ebbing:
‚È‚Ì‚è‚»‚â“E‚Ü‚Ş,nanoriso ya tsumamu,gather seaweed,The seaweed let us harvest here;
ŠL‚âE‚Í‚Ş‚â,kai ya hirowamu ya,gather shellfish,The shellfish let us gather up;
‹Ê‚âE‚Í‚Ş,tama ya hirowamu ya,gather pearls,The pearls let us pluck from the shells.
