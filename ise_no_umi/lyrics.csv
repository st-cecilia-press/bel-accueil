Lyrics,Transliteration,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
伊勢の海の,ise no umi no,the sea at Ise,"The ocean at Ise,"
きよき渚に,kiyoki nagisa ni,the pure beach,"With its beaches clean, flawless,"
潮間に,shiogai ni,at low tide,When tide is ebbing:
なのりそや摘まむ,nanoriso ya tsumamu,gather seaweed,The seaweed let us harvest here;
貝や拾はむや,kai ya hirowamu ya,gather shellfish,The shellfish let us gather up;
玉や拾はむ,tama ya hirowamu ya,gather pearls,The pearls let us pluck from the shells.
