Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Quand je veux en amour prendre mes passetés,","When I want to take it slow in love,","When I would rather go slowly or take a break,"
"Ma mie, en se moquant, layd et vieillart me nomme:","My girlfriend, laughing, calls me ugly and old:","My girlfriend, who laughs and laughs, calls me ""old man"" and ""ugly""."
"""Quoy,"" dit elle, ""reveur, tu as plus de cent ans,","""What!"", she says, ""Dreamer, you're over a hundred years old,","""What!"" she says, ""You must be more than a hundred now!"
"Et tu veux contrefayr' encore le jeun' homme.""","And you want to act the young man again.""","And once again you’re trying to act like a young man!"""

"Alors je luy respon, ""Quant à moy, je ne scay","Then I answered her, ""As for me, I do not know","I answered her like this: ""As for me, I don’t know"
"Si j'ay loeil chassieux, si j'ay perdu courage,","If my eyes are bleary, if I have lost my courage,","If I am halfway blind, if I have lost my courage,"
"Si mes cheveux sont noirs ou si blancs,","If my hair is black or white,","Or if my hair is black, or if now it is white."
"Car jamays je n'apprins de mirer mon visage.""","Because I have never learned to admire my face.""","I’m not one to admire my own face in the mirror."""
