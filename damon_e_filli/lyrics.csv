Damon e Filli insieme ,LINK,"Damon and Phyllis fighting,"
Guerreggiavan fra lor con forze estreme,http://www1.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Damon_e_Filli_(Orazio_Vecchi),Locked together as two impassioned forces.
"Pari eran l’armi, i colpi e le ferite",See Mick Swinthinbank's work at Choral Public Domain Library.,Their blows and blades were equally inciting;
Et era amor presente a si gran lite.,,The God of Love was witness to their courses.
,,
Eran guardi possenti le lor armi,,"Their swords were heated glances,"
Ch’avean salde e pungenti;,,Which were sturdy and strong and monumental;
Eran sospiri i colpi e i cari baci,,Their shots were sighs; their cuts were small advances;
Erano le ferite accorte e audaci.,,"Their wounds so deep were kisses, soft and gentle."
,,
Ma si cangiò la sorte:,,But then their fate was altered:
Cha dà colpo mortal sentendo morte,,"When her breast felt a blow she could not live through,"
Filli nel petto cede e s’abbandona,,Then Phyllis stopped and yielded ere she faltered.
"Dicendo: Amico, io ti perdon, perdona",,"She said, ""My friend, forgive me; I forgive you."
,,
Non fia mal che tu pera,,"""Live long; you will recover."""
"All’hor disse Damon, dolce guerriera;",,"Damon said, ""Warrior, my sweet, this thrilling"
Questa che ti par morte è dolce vita,,"You take for death is life, who calls each lover"
Ch’a guerregiar spesso gl’amanti invita.,,"To clash in mortal combat, fierce and willing."""
,,
Orazio Vecchi,,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
