A lieta vita,To a happy life,To what delights us
amor c'in vita,Love invites us.,Fair Love invites us.

doner? il core,Will give that heart,"Cling to Him tightly,"
a un tal signore.,To such a Lord.,This Lord so mighty.
,,
Hor lieta hormai,Today is the time of happiness;,Today be cheerful;
scacciando i guai,Trouble is cast out.,"Cast out the tearful,"

Privo ? di fede.,Lacks faith.,No faith without Him.
Onde haver merta,Therefore he will deserve,Their restitution
Contra se aperta,The opposite of openness:,Is retribution:
L'ira e'l furore,The ire and the fury,"His rage burns brightly,"

E foco e strali.,And fire and arrows.,With bolts and fire.
Dunque s'adore,Therefore worship,So worship rightly
Un tal Signore.,Such a Lord.,This Lord so mighty.
