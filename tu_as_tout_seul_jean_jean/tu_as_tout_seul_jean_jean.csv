Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Tu as tout seul, Jean, Jean, vignes et prés,",LINK,"You have them all, Jean, Jean, the vines and plains;"
"Tu as tout seul ton or et ta pécune,","http://www2.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Tu_as_tout_seul,_Jean,_Jean_(Cl%C3%A9ment_Janequin)","You have them all, your gold and all your treasure;"
Tu as tout seul des logis diaprés,See Mick Swithinbank's work at Choral Public Domain Library.,"You have them all, your buildings and domains:"
"Où nul vivant n'y prétend chose aucune,",,No man disputes them; savor them at leisure.
"Tu as tout seul ton bonheur et fortune,",,"You have it all, your money, ease and pleasure;"
Tu as tout seul ton vivre et ton repas.,,"You have it all, your room and board for life."
"Tu as tout seul toutes choses fors une,",,You have it all: Your worth no man could measure;
C'est que tout seul ta femme tu n'as pas.,,All things on earth are yours except your wife!
