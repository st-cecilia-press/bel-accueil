Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Bel acueil le sergent d'Amours,"Fair Welcome, the sergeant of Love,","Bel Acueil, Love's sure deputy,"
Qui bien sait faire ses esploitz,"Who knows well how to serve Love's writs,","Who serves Love's summons, stern and fair,"
,, 
M'a ja cité par plusieurs fois,Has already cited me many times,Has cited me with manful care
D'aler à l'une de ses cours,"To go to one of his courts,","And into court oft summoned me,"
,, 
Et m'a promis qu'à tous les jours,And has promised me that every day,And vowed that in contempt I'll be
Mectra default se je n'y vois,"I will be in default if I do not go,","If to refuse Love's writ I dare,"
,, 
Bel acueil le sergent d'Amours,"Fair Welcome, the sergeant of Love,","Bel Acueil, Love's sure deputy,"
Qui bien sait faire ses esploitz,"Who knows well how to serve Love's writs,","Who serves Love's summons, stern and fair."
,,
Et que se bref je n'y accours,"And if, in brief, I do not go quickly","If I do not go hastily,"
"O mes consulz secretz et cois,","With my secret and quiet counsels,","My secret heart and mind to share,"
,, 
"M'en bannira de toutes voys,",He will banish me from ever visiting,He'll banish me for good from there;
Et plus ne m'y fera secours,And will never again help me.,His help no longer will I see.
,,
Bel acueil le sergent d'Amours,"Fair Welcome, the sergeant of Love,","Bel Acueil, Love's sure deputy,"
Qui bien sait faire ses esploitz,"Who knows well how to serve Love's writs,","Who serves Love's summons, stern and fair,"
,, 
M'a ja cité par plusieurs fois,Has already cited me many times,Has cited me with manful care
D'aler à l'une de ses cours.,To go to one of his courts.,"And into court oft summoned me,"
,,
