Kyrie eleyson.,"Lord, have mercy.","Lord, have mercy upon us."
,,
"Amor, qui cor vulnerat","Love, which wounds","To injure lovers fated,"
"humanum, quem generat","the human heart,","By carnal lust created,"
"carnalis affectio,","love, which carnal lust creates,",Love never has existed
numquam sinevicio,never or rarely,Without the cold and twisted
"vel raro potest esse,","can exist without sin,","Effects of sin, for surely"
"quoniam est necesse,",for it must be,The more love given purely
ut quo plus diligitur,that the more,To anything that passes
"res, que cito labitur",a thing which quickly decays,Away like fragile grasses
"et transit, eominus","and passes away is loved,","And to decay is driven,"
diligatur Dominus.,the less the Lord is loved.,The less the Lord is given.
,,
Aucuns vont souvent,Some often go around,Some say publicly
par leur envie mesdisant,"badmouthing love out of envy,","Bad things about love from envy,"
"d’amours, mes il n’est si bonne vie",but there is no life as good,And yet there is no life as good for you
com d’amer loiaument;,as loving loyally;,"As loving loyally,"
quar d’amours vient,for from love comes,For from love all
toute courtoisie,all courtesy,"Courtesies soon grew, all"
et tout honour et tout bon ensegnement.,and all honor and all good upbringing.,Honor and all good upbringing came to be.
"Tout ce puet en li prouver, qui amie",All of this can be shown by one who takes,All of this can be seen in a person who
veut faire sans boidie,a sweetheart without deceit,Loves someone and is true
"et amer vraiement,",and loves truly.,And loves in purity.
que ja en liniert assi se vilanie,"Villainy will never reside in him,","Villainy never is found in what he may do,"
ne couvoitise d’amasser argent.,nor will the desire to amass money.,Nor does he desire to gather money.
Ains aime bonne compaignie,"Rather, he loves fair company","Rather, his friends have fair virtue;"
et despent adés largement;,"and always spends money generously,","He spends money generously,"
et si n’a en li felonnie,and there is in him no ill will,"And no ill will does he have in view,"
"n’envie sus autre gent,","nor envy toward other people,","Nor for anyone envy,"
mes a chascun s’umelie,but he humbles himself,"But he humbles himself, too,"
et parole courtoisement.,and speaks courteously toward other people —,"Speaking to all courteously,"
S’il a du tout sans partie,"if he has wholly, without exception,",If he set his heart all through
mis son cuer en amer entierement;,set his heart entirely on loving.,"On loving without exception, entirely."
"et sachiés, quil n’aime mie",And know that he who conducts himself otherwise,"If these things he does not do,"
"ains ment, s’il se demaine autrement.","does not love at all; rather, he lies.","He has not love, but dishonesty."
