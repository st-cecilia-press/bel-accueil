Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Questa dolce Sirena, ",This sweet siren,The sweetly singing siren
"col canto acqueta il mar, ",Quiets the sea with her song;,"With song makes waves to cease,"
un suo leggiadro riso,One of her beautiful smiles,And with a smile serenely
Pu≈à l'aria serenar.,Can pacify the air.,Turns howling winds to peace.
,,
Chi mira'il suo bel viso,Whoever looks upon her beautiful face,Who gazes on her visage
"resta prigion d'Amor, ",Remains imprisoned by Love;,Love will not let depart;
ch'i suoi bei lumi vede,Whoever sees her beautiful eyes,Who sees her eyes is stricken
sente legars'il cor.,Feels bound by the heart.,And tethered by the heart.
,,
Giovanni Gastoldi,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
