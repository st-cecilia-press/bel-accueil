Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
So ben mi ch’ha bon tempo,"I know very well who’s having a good time,","I know who has a good time,"
Al soma bastamo,But that’s all I can say.,But that’s all I will say.
,,
So ben ch’e favorito,I know very well who is the favorite.,I know who is the favorite;
Ahime! no’l posso dir.,Alas! I can’t say who it is.,Too bad I can’t say who.
,,
O s’io potessi dire,"Oh, if I could only say",If I could only tell you
"Chi va, chi sta, chi vien,","Who goes, who stays, and who comes!","Who goes, who stays, who comes!"
,,
La ti dara martello,"If I hit you with it,","But if I hit you with it,"
Per farti disperar.,You would despair.,I know that you’d despair.
,,
Saluti e bacciamani,Greetings and hand-kissing --,"Fond greetings, hugs and kisses:"
Son tutti indarno a fé,They’re all faithful in vain.,They all stay true in vain.
,,
Non giova dare il Zanni,"It’s not good to give to the Zanni,","Don’t give yourself to jesters,"
Andando su e giu.,Going up and down.,Who tumble up and down.
,,
Al puo ben impiccarsi,You might as well hang yourself,"As fast as you’ll get nowhere,"
Ch’al non fara nien.,As do nothing.,You might as well go hang.
,,
Paseggia pur chi vuole,Take a walk if you want;,Go walking if you’d rather;
Ch’el tempo perdera.,It’s a waste of time.,It’s all a waste of time.
,,
"O parli, o ridi, o piangi,","Speak, laugh, or cry:",So nag or howl or blubber:
Non trovera pieta.,You will find no mercy.,You’ll find no sympathy.
,,
"Dice il proverbio antico,",Like the old saying goes:,It’s like the famous saying:
Chi ha fatto suo buon pro.,Do what’s good for yourself.,Look out for number one!
,,
