et sequitur,and it follows,"It will alter,"
"agrum nunc floridum,",that the fields now in flower,"Dead fields untameable,"
quem aridum,"will be dry,",Once arable.
cras cernes. Igitur,you will see tomorrow. So,To fail to exalt her
improprium,it would be improper,As turnable
non edo canticum:,not to send forth the song:,Is impermissible:
o varium,O varying,"O changeable,"
Fortune lubricum.,and slippery Fortune.,O Fortune flexible!
