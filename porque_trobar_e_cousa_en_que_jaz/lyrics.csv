"Este é o Prólogo das Cantigas de Santa María, ementando as cousas que á mestér eno trobar.","This is the Prologue of the Songs of Holy Mary, concerning the things which are necessary in the art of composing
songs.",
,,
Porque trobar é cousa en que jaz,Because composing songs is an art which requires great,"Because composing songs is such an art,"
"entendimento, porên queno faz","understanding, therefore, he who undertakes it","Requiring understanding from the start,"
"á-o d' aver e de razôn assaz,","must have this quality, and good judgment,",The good composer must possess a heart
per que entenda e sábia dizer,so that he may understand and be able to say,"Of sense and insight and a prudent mind,"
"o que entend' e de dizer lle praz,","that which he undersatands and wishes to express,","So he can understand and speak his part,"
ca ben trobar assí s' á de fazer.,for thus are good songs made.,For songs that touch the soul are so designed.
 ,,
E macar éu estas dúas non ei,Although I do not possess these two qualities to the degree,Such prudence and such insight are not mine
"com' éu querría, pero provarei","that I might wish, I shall nonetheless try","As much as I would have by my design,"
"a mostrar ende un pouco que sei,","to show the little that I know of the art,",But still I try to elevate each line
"confïand' en Déus, ond' o saber ven;","trusting in God, from Whom wisdom comes,",And show the little that is known to me;
ca per ele tenno que poderei,for with His aid I believe I can,"And with the aid of Providence divine,"
mostrar do que quéro alg?a ren.,accomplish to some extent that which I seek.,I may achieve my aim to some degree.

E o que quéro é dizer loor,And that which I seek is to praise,My aim is only to adore and praise

"Santa María, que ést' a mellor","holy Mary, the most wondrous","O Holy Mary, worthy to amaze"
cousa que el fez; e por aquest' éu,"of His creations. Therefore, I wish from this day forth",Beyond all else created on this earth.
"quéro seer oi mais séu trobador,","to be Her troubadour,","And thus, I wish today and all my days"
e rógo-lle que me queira por séu,and I pray that She will have me […],To be Her troubadour for all I'm worth.
 ,,
Trobador e que queira méu trobar,"[…] for her troubadour and accept my songs,","I pray that She accept the songs I sing,"
"receber, ca per el quér' éu mostrar",for through them I seek to reveal,For through these songs Her miracles I bring
dos miragres que ela fez; e ar,the miracles She performed. Hence,To ears who will respond by worshipping.
querrei-me leixar de trobar des i,from now on I choose to sing,For other ladies I will sing no more;
"por outra dona, e cuid' a cobrar","for no other lady, and I think thereby to recover",With this I may recover everything
per esta quant' enas outras perdí.,all that I have wasted on the others.,I wasted on the loves I sang before.
 ,,
"Ca o amor desta Sennor é tal,",For the love of this Lady is such,Her love is such that who Her love obtains
que queno á sempre per i mais val;,"that he who has it is forever the more worhty for it,","Becomes more worthy to receive its gains,"
"e poi-lo gaannad' á, non lle fal,","and once he has earned it, never does it fail him,","And once he earns it, always it remains,"
"senôn se é per sa grand' ocajôn,","unless, to his misfortune,",Unless he turn his back on God above
"querendo leixar ben e fazer mal,",he departs from good and does wrong.,And sadly he his wickedness sustains.
ca per esto o pérd' e per al non.,"Thus, and in no other way, does he lose it.",No other way is there to lose Her love.
 ,,
"Porên dela non me quér' éu partir,","Therefore, I will never depart from Her,","So from my Lady's side I'll never leave,"
"ca sei de pran que, se a ben servir,",for I know full well that if I serve Her faithfully,For if I rightly serve Her I'll receive
que non poderei en séu ben falir,I shall never be deprived,"Her blessing and Her beautiful reprieve,"
"de o aver, ca nunca i faliu",of Her blessing. No one ever failed to receive it,Which She has always graciously conferred
"quen llo soube con mercee pedir,","who humbly begged for it,","On those who humbly beg and simply grieve,"
ca tal rógo sempr' ela ben oiu.,for such a prayer She always heard.,For such a prayer Our Lady always heard.
 ,,
"Onde lle rógo, se ela quisér,","Therefore I pray, if it be Her will,","I pray, if She would will it so to be,"
que lle praza do que dela dissér,that what I shall say of Her,The words I sing would please Her utterly
"en méus cantares e, se ll' aprouguér,","in my songs be pleasing to Her, and if it please Her,","And that if She is pleased, She give to me"
que me dé gualardôn com' ela dá,that She give me the reward which She gives,The good reward She gives to those who bring
"aos que ama; e queno soubér,",to those She loves.  He who has this assurance,Their hearts to feel Her love adoringly.
por ela mais de grado trobará.,will gladly sing for Her.,Who has this pledge of Her will gladly sing.
