Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Qual fia'l dolor,How great will be my sorrow,How much discord
"Della crudel partita Signor,","At your cruel departure, my lord,","Will mark your harsh departure, my Lord,"
"Se nel pensar solo al partire,",If just thinking about you leaving ,"Since just imagining you leaving,"
Io mi sento morire.,Makes me feel like I・m dying.,I feel I・ll die in grieving.
,,
Tu sai pur che costumi e che fede hanno ,"You know what customs and beliefs they have,","You know their ways, their creeds, how they affect you,"
"I scogli, il mare e i venti,","The rocks, the sea, and the winds,","Sharp rocks, the water, the sea wind;"
E tu non vedi ,But you do not see,But you・re not seeing
"A che tua vita credi,",To what you entrust your life.,What toys with your wellbeing.
"Ne stimi il lor' horrore e il lor' inganno,","You do not consider their horror and their deception,",You don・t perceive the danger if they reject you.
Ma s'a te pur Signor rispett' havranno ,"But if even they respect you, my Lord,","But even if, my Lord, they all respect you,"
"Il mare, i scogli e i venti,","The sea, the rocks, and the winds,","The water, the sharp rocks, the sea wind,"
"Non ・ ch'io non paventi, ",Then I cannot help but fear,Then comfort is for me thinned:
"Che'l cor fra scogli scoglio non diventi,","That among the rocks your heart will become a rock,","Your heart mid sharp rocks with sharp rocks may be twinned,"
"Non si cangi co i venti e non impare,",Will change with the winds and learn,"Turn and change with the sea wind, and learn to slaughter"
La crudelt・ del mare.,The cruelty of the sea.,With cruelty like water.
