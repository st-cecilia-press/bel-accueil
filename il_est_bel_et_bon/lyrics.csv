Il estoit deux femmes toutes d'ung pays.,,"In the town, two wives to chew the fat began,"
"Disanst l'une à l'aultre - ""Avez bon mary?""",,"Saying to each other, “Is he good, your man?”"
,,
"Il ne me courrousse, ne me bat aussy.",,"He would never scold me, never raise his hand."
"Il faict le mesnaige,",,But he does the housework
"Il donne aux poulailles,",,And he feeds the chickens
Et je prens mes plaisirs.,,While I do what I want.
,,
"Commère, c'est pour rire",,"I tell you, it’s a riot"
Quand les poulailles crient:,,To hear the chickens clucking:
"Co co dac co co dac,",,"Co co dac co co dac,"
"Petite coquette, qu'esse-cy?",,"You cute little vixen, what’s your plan?"
,,
Pierre Passereau,,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
