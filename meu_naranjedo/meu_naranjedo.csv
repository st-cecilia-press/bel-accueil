Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Meu naranjedo non ten fruta. ,My orange tree has no fruit,My oranges have not yet ripened;
"Mas agora ven,","Look for now,","For now you may see,"
No me lo toque ninguén.,But no one may touch me.,But not yet may you touch me.
,,
Meu naranjedo florido.,My orange tree is flowering.,My orange blossoms are showing;
El fruto no l’es venido.,The fruit has not come.,The fruit is not even growing.
,,
El fruto no l’es venido.,The fruit has not come.,The fruit is not even growing;
"Mas agora ven,","Look for now,","For now you may see,"
No me lo toque ninguén.,But no one may touch me.,But not yet may you touch me.
,,
"Meu naranjedo granado,",My orange tree with pomegranates:,My orange blossoms are thriving;
El fruto no l’es llegado.,The fruit has not arrived.,The fruit is not yet arriving.
,,
El fruto no l’es llegado.,The fruit has not arrived.,The fruit is not yet arriving;
"Mas agora ven,","Look for now,","For now you may see,"
No me lo toque ninguén.,But no one may touch me.,But not yet may you touch me.
