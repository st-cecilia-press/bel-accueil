Lyrics,Transliteration,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
田中の井戸に,tanaka no ido ni,at the well in the rice field,"At the well of Tanaka,"
光れる田水葱,hikareru tanagi,glistening fields with water hyacinths,Water glistens in the fields.
摘め摘め吾子女,tsume tsume akome,"holding, holding my girl child","holding, holding close my girl,"
小吾子女　たたりらり,ko akome ta ri ra ri,"my little girl child, ta ta ri ra ri,","My litle girl, ta li la li,"
田中の小吾子女,tanaka no ko akome,my little girl child in the rice field,With my little Tanaka girl.
