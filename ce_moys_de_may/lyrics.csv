"Ce moys de may, ",LINK,"This month of May,"
Ma verte cotte je vestiray.,http://www1.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Ce_moys_de_may_(Cl%C3%A9ment_Janequin),My greenest garments will swing and sway.
"De bon matin me lèveray,",See Anita Gould's work at Choral Public Domain Library.,"I'll rise up early in the day,"
Ce joly moys de may.,,This lovely month of May.
"Un sault, deux saults, trois saults,",,"One hop, two hops, three hops"
"En rue je feray,",,I'll make into the way
Pour voir si mon amy verray.,,And ask my friend to come and play.
Je luy diray qu'il me descotte;,,"I'll tell him to remove my garments,"
Me descottant le baiseray.,,And on his lips a kiss I'll lay.
"Ce moys de may, ",,"This month of May,"
Ma verte cotte je vestiray.,,My greenest garments will swing and sway.
,,
Clément Janequin,,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
