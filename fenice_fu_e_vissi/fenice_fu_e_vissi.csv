Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Fenice fu' e vissi pura e morbida,","I was a phoenix and I lived pure and delicate,","A phoenix I was, and I lived finely and purely,"
Et or son trasmutata in una tortora,And now I am transformed into a turtledove,"And now to mildest turtledove am transmuted,"
Che vollo con Amor per le bell' ortora.,That flies with Love through the beautiful orchards.,That flies with Love through orchards sublimely fruited.
,,
Arbor secho n' aqua torbida,Dry trees and murky water,The thirsty trees and murky pools surely
"No' me deleta, may per questo dubito,","Do not delight me, but because of this doubt,","Do not delight me, so because I'm suspicious,"
Va nel' astate l'inverno ven e subito.,"Go in summer, winter comes quickly.",I go in summer; winter's sudden and vicious.
,,
Tal vissi e tal me vivo e posso scrivere,So I lived and so I live and I can write,So I was alive and so now I live and say clearly:
Ch' a donna non è più chè onesta vivere.,That for a woman there is no more than to live honestly.,All you can do is live for a woman sincerely.
,,
