Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Sic mea fata canendo solor,","According to my fate I sing,","I sing for comfort, my fate allaying,"
ut nece proxima facit olor.,like a swan close to death.,"Like any swan when its life is straying,"
"Blandus heret meo corde dolor,",Sweet and worsening is the pain in my heart;,"In my heart, both pain and pleasure playing;"
roseus effugit ore color.,my pink cheeks pale.,Blood escapes my face; my lips are graying.
"Cura crescente,","My concern increases,",Minutes I savor;
"labore vigente,","I labor to breathe,",I forcefully labor;
vigore labente,my energy wanes,My energy wavers;
miser morior;,"in miserable death,",I will end in crying.
tam male pectora multat amor.,for my heart is sick from loving overmuch.,My heart is ill from escessive joying.
"a morior,","I die,","I am dying,"
"a morior,","I die,","I am dying,"
"a morior,","I die,",I am dying;
"dum, quod amem, cogor et non amor!",while the one I love is not compelled to love!,"Meanwhile, free of love my lover's joying!"
,,
"Felicitate Iovem supero,","Happiness more than Jupiter,","More bliss than Jove, enchantment entire,"
"si me dignetur, quam desidero,",if you ask me what I desire.,If you would ask to what I aspire.
si sua labra semel novero;,"If her lips I could once know,","If I kissed the lips I admire,"
"una cum illa si dormiero,","if I slept with her,","If I could sleep with her, flesh afire,"
"mortem subire,","submitting to death,",I would surrender
placenter obire,I would be pleased to come,To death that's so tender
vitamque finire,to the end of life,"And reaching for splendor,"
"statim potero,",as soon as possible:,"As I desire,"
tanta si gaudia non rupero.,"so much joy, if I did not break.",Speed to the death that would take me higher.
"a potero,","If I could,","My desire,"
"a potero,","if I could,","My desire,"
"a potero,","if I could,",My desire
prima si gaudia concepero!,if I could conceive the best joy!,Is for this happiness I'd acquire!
,,
Ubera cum animadverterem,"When I noticed her breasts,","When I saw her breasts, my heart got quicker;"
optavi manus ut involverem,"I wanted to touch them,","I longed to handle them, pinch her, flick her,"
simplicibus mammis ut alluderem,"To play around with her simple breasts,",To tug her bare teats so her thighs grow slicker.
sic cogitando sensi venerem,"And thinking so, I became aware of my penis --","And at this thought, my dick became thicker."
sedit in ore,"Seating it in her mouth,","In among roses,"
rosa cum pudore,"Shamefully red,","There she shyly poses,"
pulsatus amore,Pulsing with love.,And love all exposes.
quod os lamberem,"Licking that mouth,","I want to lick her,"
…,[line missing],"To suck a bruise, with my teeth to nick her,"
Hei lamberem,"Ah, licking it,","Just to lick her,"
hei lamberem,"Ah, licking it,","Just to lick her,"
hae lamberem,"Oh, licking it,","Just to lick her,"
luxuriando per caracterem,Marking her indulgently.,"To suck a bruise, with my teeth to nick her."
