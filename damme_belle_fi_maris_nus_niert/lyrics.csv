Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Dame bele et avenant et de biau port,","Beloved lady, beautiful and of noble demeanor,","Lady, you of noble mien and lovely face"
Arrivé sui a mal port:,You have come to behave badly:,Wounded me; the deed was base:
Je muir a grant tort.,I am dying of a great wrong.,Death will soon take place.
"Se je n'ai de vous confort,","If I do not have your comfort,","If I’m far from your embrace,"
Sans nul resort,Without any remedy,"Without your grace,"
Sui mis a la mort!,I will die!,I’m a hopeless case!
,,
"Fi, mari, devostre amour!","Fie, husband, on your love!","Husband, fie on your desires!"
Quar j'ai ami,Because I have a boyfriend,I have a friend
"Tel com il afiert a mi,","Who is faithful to me,","Who is faithful to the end,"
Qui me sert et nuit et jour,Who serves me both night and day,"Serves me as my heart requires,"
"Sanz sejour,","Without rest,","Never tires,"
De cuer mignot et joli.,With a sweet and joyful heart.,Happy at my will to bend.
"Vilains, vous demorrés","Vile ones, stay away,","Stay away, you coarse ones;"
Et je m'en vois o li!,And I will take care of my own pleasure!,To my own joy I’ll tend.
,,
Nus n'iert ja jolis,We will never have joy,Joy forever ends
S'il n'aime ,If she does not love us.,Without her.
Dame de haut pris,"Lady of high esteem,","She whom fame attends,"
Nus n'iert ja jolis.,We will never have joy.,"Joy forever ends,"
Li vostres amis,Your friends,Calls us just the friends
Vous claime.,You call us.,About her.
Nus n'iert ja jolis,We will never have joy,Joy forever ends
S'il n'aime!,If she does not love us!,Without her.
,,
