"Cum nos a fait, per sa doussor,",,"How God in Heaven in His grace,"
Lo Seingnorius celestiaus,,"Has made for us, upon a shore"
"Probet de nos un lavador,",,"Within our reach, a Washing Place."
"C'anc, fors outramar, no·n fon taus,",,"Another one was made before,"
En de lai deves Josaphas:,,"An age ago, near Israel:"
E d'aquest de sai vos conort.,,But this one's near enough to chase.
,,
Lavar de ser e de maiti,,How right to wash ourselves would be
"Nos deuriam, segon razo,",,"In morning and in evening, too --"
Ie·us o afi.,,This all may see;
Chascus a del lavar legor!,,We all may wash our hands and face.
"Domentre qu'el es sas e saus,",,"Since age and illness haunt our door,"
"Deuri' anar al lavador,",,We must attend the Washing Place.
Que·ns es verais medicinaus!,,It is the cure for every sore.
"Que s'abans anam a la mort,",,"But if we, ere we wash, embrace"

De cels qu'iran al lavador,,For those who reach the Washing Place?
Plus que l'estela gauzignaus!,,The morning star's allure and more.
Ab sol que vengem Dieu del tort,,But first we must His wrath embrace
"Que·ill fan sai, e lai vas Domas.",,And must His enemies expel.
,,
"Probet del lignatge Cai,",,"From Cain descending, many flee"
"Del primeiran home felho,",,"The rule of law, like him untrue"
A tans aissi,,To ever be;
C'us a Dieu non porta honor!,,The name of God such men debase.
Veirem qui·ll er amics coraus!,,We'll see who's faithful at the core.
C'ab la vertut del lavador,,"For through the mighty Washing Place,"
Nos sera Jhezus comunaus!,,Together Jesus we'll adore.
E tornem los garssos atras,,And now let us those brutes repel
Qu'en agur crezon et en sort,,Who signs and divinations trace.
,,
"E·il luxurios corna-vi,",,All lustful ones -- the devotee
"Coita-disnar, bufa-tizo,",,"Of food, of pride, of vinous brew,"
Crup-en-cami,,The road's debris --
Remanran inz el felpidor!,,Will burn like trash in their disgrace.
Dieus vol los arditz e·ls suaus,,"To test the brave and meek, therefore,"
Assajar a son lavador!,,"God made for us a Washing Place,"
E cil gaitaran los ostaus!,,"And these shall guard His holy shore,"
"E trobaran fort contrafort,",,"And find a mighty foe of grace,"
So per qu'ieu a lor anta·ls chas.,,And so I bound them toward that well.

E cill del temple Salamo,,And all the Holy Temple's crew
Sofron lo pes,,Have no relief
"E·l fais de l'orguoill paganor,",,From insults by a heathen race:
Per que Jovens cuoill avol laus.,,They blame our youths for fearing war.
E·l critz per aquest lavador,,The wailing for this Washing Place
Versa sobre·ls plus rics captaus,,"Upon each craven lord they pour,"
"Fraitz, faillitz, de proeza las,",,"Each failure and each broken shell,"
Que non amon Joi ni Deport.,,"Each coward, bitter, weak, and base."
,,
"Desnaturat son li Frances,",,"Degraded are the French, in brief:"
"Si de l'afar Dieu dizon no,",,"The will of God they will not do,"
Qu'ie·us ai comes.,,Thus bringing grief
"Antiocha, Pretz e Valor",,To Antioch in every case.
Sai plora Guiana e Peitaus.,,"In France, all valor's ancient lore."
"Dieus, Seigner, al tieu lavador",,"O Lord, within your Washing Place,"
L'arma del comte met en paus:,,"Allow the Count's good soul to soar,"
E sai gart Peitieus e Niort,,And give Poitou and Niort a space
Lo Seigner qui ressors del vas!,,"Of safety, Lord who vanquished Hell."
