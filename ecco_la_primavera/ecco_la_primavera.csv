"Ecco la primavera,",LINK,"Spring is here, with its graces,"
"Che’l cor fa rallegrare,",http://www1.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Ecco_la_primavera_(Francesco_Landini),So all our hearts are breezy.
Temp’è d’annamorare,See translation at Choral Public Domain Library.,To fall in love is easy;
E star con lieta cera.,,Time to have happy faces.
,,
Noi vegiam l’aria e’l tempo,,All the fresh air around us
Che pur chiam’ allegria,,Making us newly cheerful.
,,
In questo vago tempo,,Time for a change has found us;
Ogni cosa vagheça.,,Beauty in all amasses.
,,
L’erbe con gran frescheça,,"Fresh are the newborn grasses,"
"E fior’ coprono i prati,",,"The fields are full of flowers,"
E gli albori adornati,,"And all the trees are towers,"
Sono in simil manera.,,Blossoming in their places.
,,
Ecco la primavera,,"Spring is here, with its graces,"
Che’l cor fa rallegrare,,So all our hearts are breezy.
Temp’è d’annamorare,,To fall in love is easy;
E star con lieta cera.,,Time to have happy faces.

Francesco Landini,,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
