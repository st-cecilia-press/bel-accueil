Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Se la face ay pale,",LINK,"If my cheeks are ashen,"
"La cause est amer,",http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=89583,It's love that pales my face.
"C'est la principale,",See David Wyatt's work at Liedernet Archive.,Love in all its passion
Et tant m'est amer,,Is devoid of grace:
"Amer, qu'en la mer",,I would in its place
Me voudroye voir;,,Leave this earthly land;
"Or, scet bien de voir",,"She must understand,"
La belle a qui suis,,My commander fair:
Que nul bien avoir,,"No delight can stand,"
Sans elle ne puis.,,Not without her there.
,,
Se ay pesante malle,,"May I have compassion,"
"De dueil a porter,",,Bearing my grief with grace?
Ceste amour est male,,"Arduous is passion,"
Pour moy de porter;,,Painful to embrace:
Car soy deporter,,She desires I chase
"Ne veult devouloir,",,Nothing small or grand
Fors qu'a son vouloir,,But her demand.
"Obeisse, et puis",,She can so ensnare
"Qu'elle a tel pooir,",,"I can't lift a hand,"
Sans elle ne puis.,,Not without her there.
,,
C'est la plus reale,,In her stately fashion
"Qu'on puist regarder,",,"Royalty I can trace,"
De s'amour leiale,,And my loyal passion
"Ne me puis guarder,",,I cannot erase.
Fol sui de agarder,,It is mad to chase
Ne faire devoir,,Thoughts to flout command
D'amour recevoir,,For another's hand;
"Fors d'elle, je cuis;",,"Pain is everywhere,"
"Se ne veil douloir,",,"But I cannot stand,"
Sans elle ne puis.,,Not without her there.
,,
Guillaume Dufay,,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
