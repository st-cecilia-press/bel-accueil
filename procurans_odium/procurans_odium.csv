Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Procurans odium    effectu proprio,"The effects of hate turn back on the haters,",Those souls who hatred pour    on us whose love is deep
vix detrahentium    gaudet intentio.,"scarcely detracting from our joy, as they intend.",Will not enjoy the store    of wickedness they heap.
Nexus est cordium    ipsa detractio:,Connection is the heart of detraction:,Connection's at the core    of separation's keep
sic per contrarium    ab hoste nescio,"so, contrary to the enemy’s will, I know","With every hateful roar,    our foes, like stupid sheep,"
fit hic provisio;,the provision is made;,Provide love's fuel for cheap:
in hoc amantium    felix condicio.,"in this situation, lovers are happy.",It makes true love much more    into our hearts to creep.
,,
"Insultus talium    prodesse sentio,","I feel the benefit of such attacks,",The insults I ignore    my benefit will heap;
tollendi tedium    fulsit occasio;,a shining opportunity of removing our tedium;,"Their words annoy and bore,    but at this chance I leap!"
"suspendunt gaudium    pravo consilio,","their perverse plan is to suspend joy,","For while they make their war    our joy must wait and sleep,"
sed desiderium    auget dilatio:,but desire is increased by delay:,But our desire will soar    and with delay grow deep.
tali remedio,such a remedy;,This remedy I keep:
de spinis hostium    uvas vindemio.,from the thorns of my enemy I harvest grapes.,From thorns that stung and tore    these lucious grapes I reap.
,,
