Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Tosto che l'alba del bel giorno appare,As soon as the dawn of the beautiful day appears,"Just as the new and splendid morning is dawning,"
Isveglia li cacciator:,the hunters arise:,The hunters get out of bed:
"""Su, su, su, su, ch' egli è'l tempo!""","""Up, up, get up! for it is time!","""Up, up, up, up! Get up! It's time!"""
"""Alletta li can, te, te, te, te,","Call out the dogs, You, You [or, Here, here],","""Call out for the dogs, here, here, here, here, "
"Viola, te, Primera, te!""","You, Viola! You, Primera!""","Viola, here, Primera, here!"""
Su alto al monte con buon cani al mano,Up high on the mountain with good dogs at hand,"Up high on the mountain with the dogs at the ready,"
"E gli bracchetti al piano,","and the hounds quiet,","The hounds are hushed and steady,"
E ne la piaggia ad ordine ciascuno.,and on the field everyone in order.,And in the meadow the men are all in order.
,,
Io veggio sentir uno de' nostri miglior bracchi.,I see one of our best hounds scenting.,I see that one of our swiftest hounds has scented something.
Starà avvisato.,Stand alert!,So be alert now!
"""Bussate d'ogni lato ciascun","""Let each one beat the bushes on all sides","""Let's beat the bushes on every side,"
"le macchie che Quaglina suona!""","for the quail calls!""","For I can hear the quail is calling!"""
"""Ai-o, ai-o!"" A te la cerbia viene.","""Ayo, ayo!"" The young doe is coming to you.","""Ayo! ayo!"" To you the doe is headed."
Carbon la prese e in bocca la tene.,Carbon has seized her and holds her in [his] mouth.,Carbon has seized her with his teeth embedded.
,,
Del monte que che v'era su gridava,From the mountain that one who was there shouted,"From mountaintops their calls and shouts abounded,"
Al altra da l'altra e suo corno sonava.,to one and to another and sounded his horn.,Loudly and loudly the hunting horn sounded.
