東屋の,azumaya no,the eastern [summer] house's,At the eastern house
真屋のあまりの,maya no amari no,gabled roof; an abundance,Many eaves and gables are;
その雨そそぎ,sono ama sosoki,of that rain is pouring,This rain is pouring from them.
我立ち濡れぬ,ware tachi nurenu,"I stand, wet",As I stand here I am drenched.
殿戸開かせ,tonodo hirakase,open the door of the hall,The door I beg you open.
,,,
鎹も,kasugai mo,there is no metal tie,"Neither a bolt, no,"
錠もあらばこそ,tozashi mo araba koso,no lock is there at all,"Nor a bar, no, have I to fasten,"
その殿戸,sono tonodo,this back door,Fasten this hall door.
我鎖め,ware sasame,for me to chain,How could I lock it?
おし開いて来ませ,oshi hiraite kimase,push it open and come in,"Just push it open, love, and come in,"
我や人妻,ware ya hitozuma,I am [your] wife,For I am no one else's.
