Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Prendés I garde,",Take care that no one,"Look at him, sharing"
S'on me regarde!,looks at me!,If he is staring!
"S'on mi regarde,","If anyone looks at me,","If he is staring,"
Dites le moi.,tell me.,Tell me right now.
C'est tout la jus en cel boschaige:,It is all down there in those woods.,Hear the voices there in the forest:
"Prendés I garde,",Take care that no one,"Look at him, sharing"
S'on me regarde!,looks at me!,If he is staring!
La pastourele I gardoit vaches:,The country girl tends the cows:,Country girls are tending the cattle:
Plaisans brunette a vous m'otroi!,"Pretty brunette, I am yours!","Pretty brunette, I'm yours, I vow!"
"Prendés I garde,",Take care that no one,"Look at him, sharing"
S'on me regarde!,looks at me!,If he is staring!
"S'on mi regarde,","If anyone looks at me,","If he is staring,"
Dites le moi.,tell me.,Tell me right now.
