"Tmeiskin was jonck,",LINK,"She was quite young,"
"wel van passe, niet te groet.",http://www2.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Tmeiskin_was_jonck_(Heinrich_Isaac),And she was the perfect size.
Ic quam gheloepen met eenem spronck.,See Mick Swithinbank's work at Choral Public Domain Library.,In fervor toward her myself I flung
Ic custe se an haren roede mont.,,And kissed her on her mouth of rosy red.
"Scoen lief, ghy compt zo selden.",,"""My love, you come so rarely,"
"Ey ridder, seyt so edel ghenoet,",,"My champion, princely hero, my prize;"
hu liefde quelt my totter doet.,,"This yearning love is my demise."""
