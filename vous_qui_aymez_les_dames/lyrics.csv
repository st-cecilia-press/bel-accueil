Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Vous, qui aymez les dames,","You who love ladies,","All you who love the ladies,"
blande loquimini,"speak smoothly,",Smoothly enrapture them.
"dites-leur qu'elles sont belles,","Tell them that they are beautiful,",Tell them that they are appealing
et adulamini,and flatter them.,And kindly flatter them.
"touchez-leur les mamelles,","Touch their breasts,","Their breasts intently feeling,"
et obsculamini,and kiss them.,With kisses cover them.
"sy troys foys elles souffrent, ","If they tolerate it three times,","If they endure it three times,"
chantez laetamini,"sing, rejoice;","Sing joy, and savor them:"
voz besognes sont faites,Your tasks are done,Your tasks have been accomplished;
in nomine Domini,in the name of God.,The name of God honors them.
