Lyrics,Transliteration,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
美濃山に,minoyama ni,in the mountains of Mino,In Mino's mountains
繁に生たる,shiji ni oitaru,naturally in thick growth,"In freedom, as nature wills,"
玉柏,tamagashiwa,the jewel oaks,Flourish the Pearl Oaks.
豊明に,toyonoakari ni,at the next abundant harvest,At the feast at Festival
会ふが楽しさや,au ga tanoshisa ya,it would be pleasant to meet,It would be pleasant to meet you;
会ふが楽しさや,au ga tanoshisa ya,it would be pleasant to meet,It would be pleasant to meet you.
