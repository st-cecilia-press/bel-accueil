Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Caballeros de Alcal?,"Knights of Alcal?,","Knighted nobles of Alcal?,"
Entrastes a facer presa,You entered in to take prey.,"You came here to hunt your quarry,"
Et fallastes un morillo,You missed a Moorish man,But you missed a Moorish fellow
Entre Estrepona y Marbella.,Between Estrepona and Marbella.,Close to Estrepona and Marbella.
,,
Lope Martinez,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
