"Puer nobis nascitur,","A child is born to us,",Unto us is born a child;
Rector angelorum;,Leader of the angels;,Angel hosts obey him.
In hoc mundo pascitur,In this world eats,In this world he has appeared:
Dominus Dominorum.,the Lord of Lords.,Exalt the Lord and praise him.

In presepe positum,"Placed in a manger,","In a manger so austere,"
Sub foeno asinorum,"Beneath the straw of donkeys,","Lying in the hay dust,"
Cognoverunt Dominum,"The Lord could be recognized,","This small baby, it was clear,"
"Christum, Regem Coelorum.","Christ, the King of Heaven.",Was Christ who came to save us.
,,
Hunc Herodes timuit,This Herod feared,"Herod, anxious and afraid,"
Magno cum tremore;,With great trembling;,"Trembled, turning ashen."
In infantes irruit,He rushed to the children,Newborn children he waylaid
Hos caedens in furore.,And beat them in anger.,And killed in raging passion.
,,
Qui natus ex Maria,He who was born of Mary,"Son of Mary born today,"
Die hodierna:,Today:,"Fount of our salvation,"
"Duc nos, tua gratia,",Lead us by Your grace,Lead us gently all the way
Ad gaudia superna.,To joy above.,To Heaven's jubilation.

Cantemus in choro;,We sing in chorus;,We will sing in chorus;
Cantemus in organo:,We sing with the organ:,We will sing with organ chords
Benedicamus Domino.,"""Bless the Lord.""",To you who suffered for us.
