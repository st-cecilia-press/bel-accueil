Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
"Iai par trop longuement ayme, ","Having loved too long,",Too long this love has enflamed me;
"Ie scay bien a quoi me tenir, ",I know well what to stick to.,By now what to expect I've learned.
"Ie suis et veulx estre blasme,",I am and I want to be blamed;,I'm blamed; I want her to blame me.
"Cest le gain qui me doit venir, ",It is the gain that must come to me,This torment is the prize I earn
"Las, quant ce vient au souvenir ",When the memory returns to me.,"Each time the memories return,"
"Rn pensant ou iay mis le temps,","Thinking where I spent my time,","And thinking where my time I spent,"
Ie puis bien dire sans faillir: ,"I can say without deceiving myself,",I cry sincerely while I burn:
"Pardonnes moy, ie me repens.","""Forgive me; I repent.""","""Forgive me, please! I do repent."""
