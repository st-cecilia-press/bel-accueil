Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Mery yt ys whil sumer ylast ,Merry it is while summer lasts,Merry it is while summer lasts
With fugheles song.,With birds' songs.,With birds in song.
Oc! Now negheth windes blast ,Ah! Now approach blasts of wind,But then comes the cold wind's blast
And weder strong.,And strong weather.,And weather strong.
Ey! Ey! What this night is long,Ay! Ay! This night is so long,"Ei, ei! how this night is long,"
"And I wit wel muchel wrong,","And I, having been done much wrong,","And I, being done great wrong,"
Sorwe and murne and fast.,Sorrow and mourn and fast.,Sorrow and mourn and fast.
