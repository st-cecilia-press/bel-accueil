Lyrics,Direct Translation,Poetic Translation
Amor è ritornato,Love has returned.,Now Love from war returning
"Dal campo il dispietato,","From the field, the miserable",Brings from the field the yearning:
"E milion avanti,","In millions go forward,","Millions, as miles he covers"
Mena il suo carro di prigion' Amanti.,Brought in his wagon of captive lovers.,And drives along his cart of captive lovers.
,,
Luca Marenzio,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann,Carol Anne Perry Lagemann
